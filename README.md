# Downloader-renamer
downloads and renames the mangas downloaded from nhentai into a more friendly way to windows. 
it works with ubuntu and i suppose linux. but i can't get libtorrent working with windows. if you can then you probably can run it in windows too.
when libtorrent updates and make it easily instalablle in python i'll update the code

## how to use

* Download the all the files in the same folder.
* Run hentaibot.py (in linux you right click in the folder, open terminal and write `python3 hentaibot.py`)
* now you need to probide a path for:
Where are your torrent from nhentai stored
Where you want the to be downloaded
Where the renamed version that is compatible with windows is going to be copied

bear in mind that if you run renamer twice it will duplicate the files. this happens because some issue with manga with really similar and long names.

# Downloader-renamer
downloads and renames the mangas downloaded from nhentai into a more friendly way to windows. 
it works with ubuntu and i suppose linux. but i can't get libtorrent working with windows. if you can then you probably can run it in windows too.
when libtorrent updates and make it easily instalablle in python i'll update the code
